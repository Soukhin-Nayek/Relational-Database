# Relational-Database
A relational database is a database where all data age organized in terms of relations
or tables of records or tuples or rows. Relations can be thought of as sets of records. 
Each record is an array of attribute values (also called columns). Finally, the database 
is a collection of such relations. The attributes in a relation are also described in a 
schema using attribute names, which are used as keys for various operations on the 
data in a database. For more details, see:

Divide the code into the following:
• A header file (rdb.h) that has all the Library API.
• A C++ file (rdb-basics.cpp) with implementations of all the basic operators.
• A C++ file (rdb-join.cpp) with the implementation of the join operation.
• A C++ file (rdb-attr.cpp) with all supported attribute types implementations.
• A C++ file (rdb-main.cpp) with the implementation of the UI
